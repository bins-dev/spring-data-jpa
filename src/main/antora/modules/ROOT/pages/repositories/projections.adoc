NOTE: It is important to note that <<projections.dtos,Class-based projections>> with JPQL is limited to *constructor expressions* in your JPQL expression, e.g. `SELECT new com.example.NamesOnly(u.firstname, u.lastname) from User u`.
(Note the usage of a FQDN for the DTO type!) This JPQL expression can be used in `@Query` annotations as well where you define any named queries.
And it's important to point out that class-based projections do not work with native queries AT ALL.
As a workaround you may use named queries with `ResultSetMapping` or the Hibernate-specific javadoc:{hibernatejavadocurl}org.hibernate.query.ResultListTransformer[]

[NOTE]
====
Some JPA providers may require additional hints when working with <<projections.dtos,Class-based projections>> especially when using those directly with method derived queries.
If you are facing errors like `JpaSystemException: Specified result type did not match Query selection type` make sure to provide a constructor hint via `@PersistenceCreator` to be passed on, as outlined below:

[source,java]
----
public class NamesOnly {

    private final String firstname;
    private final String lastname;

    protected NamesOnly() { }

    @PersistenceCreator
    public NamesOnly(String firstname, String lastname) {
        this.firstname = firstname;
        this.lastname = lastname;
    }

    // ...
}
